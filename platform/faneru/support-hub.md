#### Managing your funnels <a href="#managing-your-funnels" id="managing-your-funnels"></a>

This is where the power and flexibility really comes in to play! Depending on your selected plan, each plan comes with a different amount of funnels. But the following context applies to any plan.

You have already seen how to create a new funnel and the same goes when creating a new website. There are some additional options to help you get the most from using Funnels for your own projects or even setting up funnels for your own clients.

**For example:** When you create an account with it is classed as a Project. Within your project you can create a website and numerous funnels. You can also Move the funnel outside of the website so you can have it separate from your main Project URL or move the funnel to another project.

#### Add funnel to website <a href="#add-funnel-to-website" id="add-funnel-to-website"></a>

Let's take for example that I have a website, and I want to add a funnel to my website.

Select the funnel you want to move > click the cog icon and this window will display.

Once selected a new window will display, this time select the website you want to add that funnel to:

Store Products, Orders, Members, Contacts and Messages will NOT BE MOVED.

Once we have moved the funnel to the selected website, you will see a change within the funnel | website tab. Let's take a look:

You can now see that under the main funnel tab, you can see that the funnel is now attached to a website 'Project' So if you create an additional funnel it will display 2 Funnels. Denoting that this specific website has two funnel attached.

#### Remove funnel from website <a href="#remove-funnel-from-website" id="remove-funnel-from-website"></a>

If you want to remove a funnel from a specific website/project - Navigate to the funnel you want to move

**Note:** this does not delete the funnel. It just moves it. You will see this warning notice display also:

Are you sure you want to make this funnel independent of the website? Existing Store Products, Orders, Members, Contacts and Messages will not be moved and will stay on the website.

Sharing you funnel enables you to share your entire funnel to another person. So for example if you have a friend who loves your killer sales funnel and you want to sell it or just share for free you can. Simply navigate to the funnel options tab and select share. It will give you a custom link that you can share or if selling add to an email or use as a redirect page.
